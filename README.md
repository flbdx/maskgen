## Overview

Maskuni is a standalone word generator based on templates (masks) describing which characters are allowed at each positions of a word.

Maskuni has two mode main modes of generation:
- **mask mode**: the words are generated from a single mask or a list of mask read from a file
- **bruteforce mode**: the words are generated from a target word length and a set of allowed charsets with constrained number of occurrences.

In addition, Maskuni has two internal generators:
- a generator for 8-bits charsets (like Hashcat's mask generator)
- a generator for unicode charsets üèÜü§ò (internally working on 32-bits characters)

### Mask mode
In its mask mode, Maskuni is largely compatible with the syntax of [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) and [Maskprocessor](https://github.com/hashcat/maskprocessor).

### Bruteforce mode
This mode actually generates masks from a set of constraints:
- the word's width
- a list of charsets each with a minimum and a maximum number of occurrences.

For example, a word of width 4 with a charset `1` allowed 0 to 4 times and a charset `2` allowed 0 to 2 times would generate the following masks:
```
1111
1112
1121
1211
2111
1122
1212
1221
2112
2121
2211
```

### Other features
- Unicode charsets:
  - `maskuni --unicode -1 '?l√©√®' '?1?1?1?1?1?1'`
- A few more built-in charsets than hashcat and less restrictions on user-defined charsets
  - named charsets: `maskuni --unicode --charset ‚Ç¨:‚Ç¨¬£¬• maskfile`
  - extend predefined charsets: `maskuni --unicode --charset l:?l√©√®√† --charset u:?u√â√à maskfile`
- Control of the word delimiter (`\n`, `\0` or no delimiter)
- A syntax for splitting the generation in equal parts (jobs)
  - `maskuni -j 7/16 masklist`

For unicode charsets, all inputs (charsets and masks) must be encoded in UTF-8 and the output is UTF-8 encoded.

### Building

Maskuni requires:
- GCC or Clang (GCC likely to produce faster code)
- CMake
- POSIX environment
- Should build at least on Linux, Cygwin and Msys2/mingw64 (recommended for windows)

Building with cmake:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make
```

### Speed

Unit is million of words per second.
Tested on a Intel core i5 @3.5Ghz writing to `/dev/null`.
|Mask|Maskuni|Maskprocessor|Maskuni with unicode|
|--|--|--|--|
|?l?l?l?l?l?l|153.7|135.5|53.5|
|?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d|148.3|130.7|40.4|

So it's pretty fast. But 2/3rd of the time is spent copying and writing the words to the output. The consuming program will also lose a significant amount of time reading from its standard input.
Therefore a standalone word generator is more suited for creating dictionaries or feeding slow consumers.

When unicode support is enabled, Maskuni is significantly slower as it will iterate over 32-bits unicode codepoints instead of 8-bits characters and therefore read or write 4 times as much memory for the same word width. And of course Maskuni must encode its output in UTF-8.

## Syntaxes

### Mask based word generation

If you are not familiar with mask-based word generation please read the [dedicated page on Hashcat's wiki](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack).

Masks are templates which define which characters are allowed at each position of a word. For each position, a mask defines either:
- a static character
- a set of allowed characters (charset)

The word generator will generate all possibilities matching the mask.

For example, if a mask means `<digit>@passwd<digit><digit>`, the word processor will generate 1000 words ranging from `0@passwd00` to `9@passwd99`.

### Charsets syntax

A charset is a named variable describing a set of characters.

In its default mode, Maskuni allows only characters encoding on a fixed width 8-bit encoding (same as Hashcat). Maskuni also supports full unicode charsets when called with `--unicode`.

Charsets are named by a single character. They are referred by the syntax `?K` where `K` is the name of the charset.

*When defining a charset, you may include another charset by writing its name (`?K`). A single `?` must be escaped by writing `??`.*

Maskuni defines the following builtin charsets:

```
?l = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
?u = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
?d = 0123456789
?s =  !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
?a = ?l?u?d?s
?h = 0123456789abcdef
?H = 0123456789ABCDEF
?n = \n (new line)
?r = \r (carriage ret)
?b = 0x00 - 0xFF (only without --unicode)
```

The last charset `?b` is not defined when using the unicode mode as the upper values can't be encoded in UTF-8.

### Masks syntax

Masks are single line strings built by concatenating descriptions of what to use at each position:
- a single char, which will always be used at this position
- a named charset (`?K`)

A single `?` must be escaped by writing `??`.

For example the previous example `<digit>@passwd<digit><digit>` is written `?d@passwd?d?d`.

Maskuni iterates from right to left. So the output of this mask is:
```
0@passwd00
0@passwd01
0@passwd02
0@passwd03
0@passwd04
0@passwd05
0@passwd06
0@passwd07
0@passwd08
0@passwd09
0@passwd10
0@passwd11
[...]
9@passwd94
9@passwd95
9@passwd96
9@passwd97
9@passwd98
9@passwd99
```

### Mask lists file syntax

Mask lists are files containing one or more masks definitions (one per line). The syntax for mask lists is the same as Hashcat's own syntax. The masks are iterated sequentially.

Mask lists can embed custom charset definitions for each mask.

The general syntax for a single line is:
`[:1:,][:2:,]...[:9:,]:mask:`
where the placeholders are as follows:
- `:1:` the named custom charset '1' (overrides `--custom-charset1` or `--charset`) will be set to this value, optional
- `:2:` the named custom charset '2' (overrides `--custom-charset2` or `--charset`) will be set to this value, optional
- ...
- `:9:` the named custom charset '9' (overrides `--charset`) will be set to this value, optional
- `:mask:` the mask which may refer to the previously defined charsets

In addition:
- a line may be commented out by starting the line with `#`
- the backslash `\` character can be used to escape another char (`\,` for a comma or `\#` for a `#`)
- as an extension, Maskuni allows up to 9 custom charsets at the beginning of a line

### Bruteforce file syntax
Bruteforce are specified by a file with the following syntax:
```
:width:
:min: :max: :charset:
:min: :max: :charset:
...
```
where the placeholders are as follows:
- `:width:` the first line must contain the width of the masks
- `:min:` the minimum number of occurrences of the charset on the same line
- `:max:` the maximum number of occurrences of the charset on the same line
- `:charset:` a charset

It's easy to create really huge attacks with the bruteforce mode so be careful :-)

## Usage

```
Usage:
  single mask or maskfile:
    maskuni [--mask] [OPTIONS] (mask|maskfile)
  bruteforce:
    maskuni --bruteforce [OPTIONS] brutefile
Generate words based on templates (masks) describing each position's charset

 Behavior:
  -m, --mask                   [DEFAULT] Iterate through a single mask or
                               a list of masks read from a file
  -B, --bruteforce             Generate the masks from a file describing
                               the word width and a range of occurrences
                               for each charsets (ex: length of 8 with 0
                               to 2 digits, 0 to 8 lowercase letters, 1
                               or 2 uppercase letters
  -u, --unicode                Allow UTF-8 characters in the charsets
                               Without this option, the charsets can only
                               contain 8-bit (ASCII compatible) values
                               This option slows down the generation and
                               disables the '?b' built-in charset

 Range:
  -j, --job=J/N                Divide the generation in N equal parts and
                               generate the 'J'th part (counting from 1)
  -b, --begin=N                Start the generation at the Nth word
                               counting from 0
  -e, --end=N                  Stop after the Nth word counting from 0

 Output control:
  -o, --output=FILE            Write the words into FILE
  -z, --zero                   Use the null character as a word delimiter
                               instead of the newline character
  -n, --no-delim               Don't use a word delimiter
  -s, --size                   Show the number of words that will be
                               generated and exit
  -h, --help                   Show this help message and exit
      --version                Show the version number and exit

 Charsets:
  A charset is a named variable describing a list of characters. Unless
  the --unicode option is used, only 8-bit characters are allowed.
  The name of a charset is a single character. It is refered using '?'
  followed by its name (example: ?d). A charset definition can refer to
  other named charsets.

  Built-in charsets:
   ?l = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   ?u = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
   ?d = 0123456789
   ?s =  !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
   ?a = ?l?u?d?s
   ?h = 0123456789abcdef
   ?H = 0123456789ABCDEF
   ?n = \n (new line)
   ?r = \r (carriage ret)
   ?b = 0x00 - 0xFF (only without --unicode)

  Custom charsets:
   Custom named charsets are defined either inline or by reading a file.
   To include a single '?' in a charset, escape it with another '?' (??).
   Pay attention to trailing newline when reading a file or to the shell
   expansion for inline definitions ('?' or '*' chars...)

   -1, --custom-charset1=CS    Define the charsets named '1', '2', '3' or
   -2, --custom-charset2=CS    '4'. The argument is either the content of
   -3, --custom-charset3=CS    the charset or a file to read.
   -4, --custom-charset4=CS

   -c, --charset=K:CS          Define a charset named 'K' with the content
                               'CS'. 'K' may be an UTF-8 char only if
                               --unicode is used. Otherwise it's a single
                               8-bit char.

 Masks:
  Masks are templates defining which characters are allowed for each
  positions. Masks are single line strings built by concatenating
  for each positions either: 
  - a static character
  - a charset reference indicated by a '?' followed by the charset
    name
  For example, '@?u?l?l?l?d@' would generate the words from
  '@Aaaa0@' to '@Zzzz9@'

  The mask argument is either a single mask definition or a file
  containing a list of masks definitions.

  Mask files can also embed charset definitions. The general syntax for
  a single line is:
   [:1:,][:2:,]...[:9:,]:mask:
  where the placeholders are as follows:
   :1: the named custom charset '1' (overrides --custom-charset1 or 
        --charset) will be set to this value, optional
   :2: the named custom charset '2' (overrides --custom-charset2 or 
       --charset) will be set to this value, optional
   ...
   :9: the named custom charset '9' (overrides --charset) will be set to
       this value, optional
   :mask: the mask which may refer to the previously defined charsets

  The characters ',' and '?' can be escaped by writing '\,' or '??'.

 Bruteforce:
  When the --bruteforce option is used, the last argument is a file which
  describes the constraints for generating the masks. Its syntax is:
    :width:
    :min: :max: :charset:
    :min: :max: :charset:
    ...
  where the placeholders are as follows:
   :width: the first line must contain the width of the masks
   :min: the minimum number of occurrences of the charset on the same line
   :max: the maximum number of occurrences of the charset on the same line
   :charset: a charset
```

## Examples

### Defining and using custom charsets

A custom charset can be defined inline as an argument:
```
$ ./maskuni -1 '01' '?1?1?1'
000
001
010
011
100
101
110
111
```

Or by writing it inside a file (pay attention to any unwanted end of line character):
```
$ echo -n 01 > charset_binary
$ ./maskuni -1 charset_binary '?1?1'
00
01
10
11
```

The options `-1`, `-2` to `-4` (or the long forms `--custom-charset1` to `--custom-charset4`) are shortcuts to define the charsets `?1` to `?4`.

Maskuni will first try to open and read a file with the given value. If none is found then the charset is defined from the argument.

The option `-c` (or `--charset`) allows to define a charset with an arbitrary name:
```
$ ./maskuni -c 'L:?l?u' '?L'
a
b
[...]
Z
Y
Z
```

A charset may reference itself to extend its definition (including predefined charsets). For example:
```
$ ./maskuni -c 1:123 -c 1:?1456 ?1
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

Masken will fully expand the user defined charsets (replace any `?X` by the corresponding charset) and uniquify them.

### Single masks

A single mask can be given inline or in a mask list file.

```
$ ./maskuni --size ?d?d?d?d?l?l
6760000
$ echo ?d?d?d?d?l?l > mask
$ ./maskuni --size mask
6760000
```

Note that commas `,` need to be escaped with `\,` when used inside a mask file.

### List of masks

Mask lists are a simple way to generate words over multiple patterns in a single invocation.
For example:
```
$ cat masks_nums_1_10 
?d
?d?d
?d?d?d
?d?d?d?d
?d?d?d?d?d
?d?d?d?d?d?d
?d?d?d?d?d?d?d
?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d
?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d
?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d
$ ./maskuni --size masks_nums_1_10 
11111111110
```

Example with inline charsets definition:

```
$ cat masks
?l?u,?1?l?l?l?l
?l?u,*$,?1?l?l?l?l?2
$ ./maskuni ./masks|grep -ie 'abcde'
abcde
Abcde
abcde*
abcde$
Abcde*
Abcde$
```

### Unicode charsets

The default mode of Maskuni is limited to 8-bit characters, which may use any character encoding. Therefore it's not possible to use characters that are usually only available on multibyte character encodings such as UTF-8.

For example, it's not possible to use smileys with the default mode of Maskuni (same with Hashcat or maskprocessor):
```
$ ./maskuni -1 'üòÇ‚ù§üòçüòäüò≠üòòüëç' emoji?1
emojiÔøΩ
emojiÔøΩ
emojiÔøΩ
emojiÔøΩ
[...]
```

This charset is read byte by byte and each byte is added to an 8-bit charset.

Maskuni can handle such character with its unicode support, enabled with `-u` or `--unicode`. *When enabled, all inputs (charsets and masks) are treated as UTF-8 encoded and the output is UTF-8 encoded*.

```
$ ./maskuni -u -1 'üòÇ‚ù§üòçüòäüò≠üòòüëç' emoji?1
emojiüòÇ
emoji‚ù§
emojiüòç
emojiüòä
emojiüò≠
emojiüòò
emojiüëç
```

Note that there are many subtleties when it comes to unicode characters. Some characters are formed by combining several characters. Emoji characters are complex and masks are not the best approach for emoji generation (see [Unicode TR#51](https://unicode.org/reports/tr51/)). In the previous example, the heart ‚ù§Ô∏é (U+2764) is actually not the very common red heart emoji ‚ù§Ô∏è which is formed by combining U+2764 with the variant selector U+FE0F. As another example, "üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶" should appears as a single glyph (if supported by the browser and if it survived the markdown rendering) but is actually a sequence of 7 characters (UTf-8 encoded as 25 bytes...).

### Bruteforce
We may extend a mask with a few special characters. For example, combining with the unicode support:
```
$ cat bf_7l_01√©√®
7
0 7 ?l
0 1 √©√®
$ ./maskuni --unicode --bruteforce --size bf_7l_01√©√®
12356631040
$ ./maskuni --unicode --bruteforce -j 80000/100000 bf_7l_01√©√® |head -5
zzwr√©kg
zzwr√©kh
zzwr√©ki
zzwr√©kj
zzwr√©kk
```
This bruteforce includes the 7 lowercases mask and results in around 1.54x more words.

Scaling this up to 8 characters results in a huge keyspace of more than 3.37 x 10<sup>11</sup> words, 4.2x more than the 8 lowercases mask.

### Partitioning the generation

To split the word space in several part, Maskuni supports two mechanisms:
- explicit numbers of the first and last words
- spliting in N equal parts (jobs)

The first method use the options `-b` (`--begin`) and/or `-e` (`--end`) with words numbered from 0:
```
$ ./maskuni -b 5 -e 7 ?d
5
6
7
```

The second method defines a job number N out of a given total. Jobs are numbered from 1.

```
$ ./maskuni -j 1/5 ?d
0
1
$ ./maskuni -j 4/5 ?d
6
7
```

The job specification is convenient to efficiently run treatments in parallel. For example using GNU parallel:
```
$ work() { ./maskuni -j "$1/$2" ?l?l?l?l?l?l | mytool; }
$ export -f work
$ N_JOBS=500
$ seq $N_JOBS | parallel -j 8 --progress work {} $N_JOBS
```
